387. First Unique Character in a String

Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.

Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode"

Output: 0

Explanation:

The character 'l' at index 0 is the first character that does not occur at any other index.

Example 2:

Input: s = "loveleetcode"

Output: 2

Example 3:

Input: s = "aabb"

Output: -1

class Solution(object):
    def firstUniqChar(self, s):
        freq={}
        for char in s:
            freq[char]=freq.get(char, 0) + 1
        for index, char in enumerate(s):
            if freq[char]==1:
                return index 
        return -1
